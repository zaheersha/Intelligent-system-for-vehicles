Iintelligent system for vehicles - using Alcohol detection sensor

Nowadays drinking alcohol and driving are the most common threats to their lives and the lives of others. We canâ€™t stop people from drinking alcohol but we can avoid such accidents by checking the person drinking and we can also keep such small devices in the vehicle to make sure there is no drink and drive. Today we are creating a simple Alcohol detector. We can use it in various application fields. So this is a small demonstration of a simple Alcohol detector using Arduino and MQ3 sensor. 

Many advanced alcohol sensors are available in the market for a reasonable price, but we are here to make this project using some basic microcontroller like Arduino, LED, Buzzer and MQ3 alcohol sensors. This is a very simple project and you can just follow the instructions given below for this project.

ARDUINO UNO:

The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc and initially released in 2010.[2][3] The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output (I/O) pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards (shields) and other circuits.[1] The board has 14 digital I/O pins (six capable of PWM output), 6 analog I/O pins, and is programmable with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment), via a type B USB cable.[4] It can be powered by the USB cable or by an external 9-volt battery, though it accepts voltages between 7 and 20 volts. It is similar to the Arduino Nano and Leonardo.[5][6] The hardware reference design is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.5 license and is available on the Arduino website. Layout and production files for some versions of the hardware are also available.

The word "uno" means "one" in Italian and was chosen to mark the initial release of Arduino Software.[1] The Uno board is the first in a series of USB-based Arduino boards;[3] it and version 1.0 of the Arduino IDE were the reference versions of Arduino, which have now evolved to newer releases.

GSM MORDULE:

A GSM modem is a specialized type of modem which accepts a SIM card, and operates over a subscription to a mobile operator, just like a mobile phone. From the mobile operator perspective, a GSM modem looks just like a mobile phone.

When a GSM modem is connected to a computer, this allows the computer to use the GSM modem to communicate over the mobile network.  While these GSM modems are most frequently used to provide mobile internet connectivity, many of them can also be used for sending and receiving SMS and MMS messages.

"When alcohol is detected  then the vehicle will stop and sends an sms to higher athirities ie drunk and drive."
